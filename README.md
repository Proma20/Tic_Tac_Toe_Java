# Tic_Tac_Toe_Java
This game has been designed using mini max algorithm to create an optimum tic tac toe game where either the agent will always win
or the game will be a draw. The code has also an alpha-beta pruning implementation. That is commented out in the given code but to use it you only have to remove the back slashes before the line if(alpha<beta).
The turns are chosen randomly. Agent uses pink cross and player gets to use blue circle.
